        <h4>Scottish Highland Cattle</h4>

        <figure><img src="images/scottishHighland_lg.jpg" alt="Scottish Highland cattle adult and calf"><figcaption>The ancient, hardy breed of beef preferred by the British Royal Family</figcaption></figure>
      <p> The Highland breed has lived for centuries in the rugged remote Scottish Highlands. The extremely harsh conditions created a process of natural selection, where only the fittest and most adaptable animals survived to carry on the breed. Originally there were two distinct classes: the slightly smaller and usually black Kyloe, whose primary domain was the islands off the west coast of northern Scotland; the other, a larger animal generally reddish in color, whose territory was the remote Highlands of Scotland. Today both of these strains are regarded as one breed-the Highland. In addition to the red and black of the original strains, yellow, dun and silver-white are also considered traditional colors.</p>

      <p>The Highland is considered a Heritage breed by the Livestock Conservancy. The Highland is actually the oldest registered breed of cattle, with the first herd book being established in 1884. Around that time, American cattlemen from the western U.S. recognized the natural qualities of the Highland animal and imported them to improve the blood lines of their herds. As a result, the Highland contributed in a great way to the success of the American cattle industry. Today Highlands are found throughout North America, as well as in Europe, Australia, and South America.</p>

      <p>Highlands require little in the way of shelter, feed supplements, or expensive grains to achieve and maintain good condition and fitness. In fact, Highland cattle seem to enjoy conditions in which many other breeds would perish. Cold weather and snow have little effect on them. They have been raised as far north as Alaska and the Scandinavian countries. They also adapt well to the more southerly climates with successful herds as far south as Texas and Georgia. Less than ideal pasture or range land is another reason to consider the Highland breed. It has been said that the Highland will eat what other cattle pass by . . . and get fat on it! The Highland is also an excellent browser, able to clear a brush lot with speed and efficiency.</p>

      <p>The Highland is a disease resistant breed. Long lashes and forelocks shield their eyes from flying insects, and as a result, pinkeye and cancer eye are uncommon. Highlands do not stress easily, so stress-related diseases occur with less frequency. And other bovine diseases affect the Highland less, due to the genetic advantages they have achieved.</p>

      <p>Despite long horns, long hair and unusual appearance, the Highland is considered an even-tempered animal - bulls as well as cows. They can also be halter trained as easily as any other breed, even more so because of the Highland's superior intelligence.</p>

      <p>The business end of any beef animal is the amount and quality of the beef it produces. Today's market is demanding premium meat, yet leaner and lower in cholesterol. The Highland carcass is ideally suited to meet this challenge. Highland beef is meat that is lean, well marbled and flavorful, with little outside waste fat since the Highland is insulated by long hair rather than a thick layer of fat. For over 20 years, the Highland and Highland crosses have graded in the top of their respective classes at the prestigious National Western Stock Show in Denver, Colorado. In the British Isles, Highland beef is recognized as the finest available and fetches premium prices. The British Royal family keeps a large herd of Highlands at Balmoral Castle, near Braemar, Scotland, and considers them their beef animal of choice.</p>

        <h5 class="notfirstsec">Why Heritage Breeds?</h5>
        <p>Traditionally, farmers throughout the world have raised thousands of different animal breeds. However, since today’s industrial farms rely upon only a few specialized types of livestock, thousands of non-commercial animal breeds have disappeared, along with the valuable genetic diversity they possessed. Fortunately, a growing number of sustainable farmers are preserving agricultural variety and protecting biodiversity by raising “heritage” or “heirloom” animal breeds.</p>
        <p>Heritage Livestock breeds are traditional livestock breeds that were raised by farmers in the past, before the drastic reduction of breed variety caused by the rise of industrial agriculture. Within the past 15-20 years, approximately 190 breeds of farm animals have gone extinct worldwide, and there are currently approximately 1,500 others at risk of becoming extinct. In the past 5-10 years alone, approximately 60 breeds of cattle, goats, pigs, horses and poultry have become extinct.  Furthermore, in the US, a few main breeds dominate the livestock industry including:</p>
        <ul>
           <li> approximately 83% of dairy cows are Holsteins and that five main breeds comprise almost all of the dairy herds in the US.</li>
            <li>approximately 60% of beef cattle are of the Angus, Hereford or Simmental breeds.</li>
            <li>approximately 75% of pigs in the US come from only 3 main breeds.</li>
            <li>approximately 60% of sheep come from only four breeds, and 40 percent are Suffolk-breed sheep.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Heritage animals were bred over time to develop traits that made them particularly well-adapted to local environmental conditions. Breeds used in industrial agriculture are bred to produce lots of milk or eggs, gain weight quickly, or yield particular types of meat within confined facilities. Heritage breeds are generally better adapted to withstand disease and survive in harsh environmental conditions, and their bodies can be better suited to living on pasture.</p>

        <p>These livestock breeds also serve as an important genetic resource, and when heritage breeds become extinct, their unique genes are lost forever and can’t be used to breed new traits into existing livestock breeds. Therefore, by raising heritage livestock breeds, sustainable farmers not only maintain variety within our livestock populations, they also help to preserve valuable traits within the species so that future breeds can endure harsh conditions.</p>

        <p>There is no official definition or certification for “heritage” animals, but for a livestock breed to be truly heritage, it must have unique genetic traits and also be raised on a sustainable farm. Heritage animals are well-suited to sustainable farms since they are able to survive without the temperature-controlled buildings and constant doses of antibiotics administered to the commercial breeds raised on factory farms.</p>

        <p>Remnant groups of many historic livestock breeds face new obstacles as modern agriculture favors “improved” breeds. Even worse, many foundational breeds of American agriculture are on the verge of going extinct. Today, let’s celebrate some of the four-legged settlers that became the foundation stock of modern American agriculture. They are a living testament to our past, and a genetic resource for our future.</p> -->
