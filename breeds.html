        <h4>Our Heritage Livestock Breeds</h4>
        <p>Our Heritage Livestock Breeds currently include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Scottish Highland Cattle - the ancient, hardy breed of beef preferred by the British Royal Family</li>
            <li>Karakul Sheep - an age-old breed of sheep with a fat tail preferred by the ethnic market</li>
            <li>Dominique Chickens - America's first breed of chicken, originally from Persia and part of the rare breeds program at Colonial Williamsburg</li>
            <li>English Shepherd Puppies - the old-fashioned farm shepherd</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Scottish Highland Cattle</h5>
        <figure><img src="images/scottishHighland_lg.jpg" alt="Scottish Highland cattle adult and calf"><figcaption>The ancient, hardy breed of beef preferred by the British Royal Family</figcaption></figure>
      <p> The Highland breed has lived for centuries in the rugged remote Scottish Highlands. The extremely harsh conditions created a process of natural selection, where only the fittest and most adaptable animals survived to carry on the breed. Originally there were two distinct classes: the slightly smaller and usually black Kyloe, whose primary domain was the islands off the west coast of northern Scotland; the other, a larger animal generally reddish in color, whose territory was the remote Highlands of Scotland. Today both of these strains are regarded as one breed-the Highland. In addition to the red and black of the original strains, yellow, dun and silver-white are also considered traditional colors.</p>
      
      <p>The Highland is considered a Heritage breed by the Livestock Conservancy. The Highland is actually the oldest registered breed of cattle, with the first herd book being established in 1884. Around that time, American cattlemen from the western U.S. recognized the natural qualities of the Highland animal and imported them to improve the blood lines of their herds. As a result, the Highland contributed in a great way to the success of the American cattle industry. Today Highlands are found throughout North America, as well as in Europe, Australia, and South America.</p>
      
      <p>Highlands require little in the way of shelter, feed supplements, or expensive grains to achieve and maintain good condition and fitness. In fact, Highland cattle seem to enjoy conditions in which many other breeds would perish. Cold weather and snow have little effect on them. They have been raised as far north as Alaska and the Scandinavian countries. They also adapt well to the more southerly climates with successful herds as far south as Texas and Georgia. Less than ideal pasture or range land is another reason to consider the Highland breed. It has been said that the Highland will eat what other cattle pass by . . . and get fat on it! The Highland is also an excellent browser, able to clear a brush lot with speed and efficiency.</p>
      
      <p>The Highland is a disease resistant breed. Long lashes and forelocks shield their eyes from flying insects, and as a result, pinkeye and cancer eye are uncommon. Highlands do not stress easily, so stress-related diseases occur with less frequency. And other bovine diseases affect the Highland less, due to the genetic advantages they have achieved.</p>
      
      <p>Despite long horns, long hair and unusual appearance, the Highland is considered an even-tempered animal - bulls as well as cows. They can also be halter trained as easily as any other breed, even more so because of the Highland's superior intelligence.</p>
      
      <p>The business end of any beef animal is the amount and quality of the beef it produces. Today's market is demanding premium meat, yet leaner and lower in cholesterol. The Highland carcass is ideally suited to meet this challenge. Highland beef is meat that is lean, well marbled and flavorful, with little outside waste fat since the Highland is insulated by long hair rather than a thick layer of fat. For over 20 years, the Highland and Highland crosses have graded in the top of their respective classes at the prestigious National Western Stock Show in Denver, Colorado. In the British Isles, Highland beef is recognized as the finest available and fetches premium prices. The British Royal family keeps a large herd of Highlands at Balmoral Castle, near Braemar, Scotland, and considers them their beef animal of choice.</p>

      <h5>Karukul Sheep</h5>
      <figure><img src="images/karukul_lg.jpg" alt="black Karukul sheep"><figcaption>The ancient, fat-tailed sheep breed preferred by the ethnic market</figcaption></figure>
      
      <p>The Karakul may be the oldest breed of domesticated sheep. Archeological evidence indicates the existence of the Persian lambskin as early as 1400 B.C. and carvings of a distinct Karakul type have been found on ancient Babylonian temples.</p>
      
      <p>The Karakul is considered a rare breed in the U.S. and most likely will remain so with a current population estimated at approximately 1300 animals. The Karakul is considered a threatened breed by the Livestock Conservancy.</p>
      
      <p>The Karakuls differ radically in conformation from many other breeds. They are of the fat broad tailed type of sheep. In their large tail is stored fat, a source of nourishment, similar in function to the camel's hump. The narrow appendage below this fat sack is often recurved, giving an S shape. Karakuls are medium-size sheep. The rams will weigh between 175-225 pounds and the ewes range from 100-150 pounds.</p>
      
      <p>Although known as the "fur" sheep, the Karakul provided more than the beautifully patterned silky pelts of the young coal black lambs. They were also a source of milk, mild flavored meat, tallow, and wool, a strong fiber that was felted into fabric or woven into carpeting.</p>
      
      <p>The Karakul is native to Central Asia and is named after a village called Karakul. A hard life imparted to the breed a hardiness and adaptability to thrive under adverse conditions, which is distinctive of the Karakul sheep to this day.</p>
      
      <p>With a growing interest in the fiber arts in the United States, there has been an increased interest in the Karakul sheep. It is a specialty breed that is finding its niche as part of the cottage industry. The fleece is seen in a variety of natural colors.</p>
      
      <p>The harsh conditions under which they evolved has given them strong and lasting teeth, a key to their longevity. They are resistant to internal parasites and foot rot. While they respond to good feed and care, they are excellent foragers and will go through a season of scant food or graze marginal land in which ordinary sheep would not survive. Karakuls withstand extremes of either hot or cold but they should have access to dry cover and be kept out of marshy pastures.</p>
      
      <p>Karakuls breed out of season, making it possible for three lamb crops in two years. The ewes are very protective and attentive mothers, resulting in a high lamb survival rate. The Karakuls posses a strong flocking instinct and can be run either on open range or in fenced pastures.</p>
      
      <p>The Karakul is distinguished by its colored fleece, which is due to a dominate black gene. Most lambs are born coal black with lustrous wavy curls, with the face, ears, and legs usually showing smooth, sleek hair. As the lamb grows, the curls opens and loses its pattern and the color generally begins to turn brownish or bluish gray, getting grayer with age. Other colors include a wide range of shades; silver blues grays, golden tans, reddish browns, white with flecks of other colors include a wide range of shades; silver blues, grays, golden tans, reddish browns, white with flecks of other colors and occasionally pure white.</p>
      
      <p>Many adults have a double coat, a fine down undercoat, covered by a coat of guard hair. The best have a fleece as glossy as their lamb coat. But there is a great variability in the fleece type of both coats, from "horse tail" coarse to silky soft. The Karakul produces a lightweight, high-volume, strong fiber fleece that, at its best is long and lustrous, usually with no crimp. Considered long-stapled (average 6" to 12" per year), the fleece lacks a high grease content. It is easily spun, with little preparation. It produces a superior carpet yam, is often used for rugs and saddle blankets, outer garments and wall-hangings, and has an excellent felting ability. It is the wool from which the art of felting evolved.</p>

      <h5>Dominique Chickens</h5>
      <figure><img src="images/dominique_lg.jpg" alt="side view of Dominique chicken"><figcaption>America's first chicken breed</figcaption></figure>

      <p>The Dominique chicken is recognized to be one of America’s oldest chicken breeds.  The Dominique is also considered a Heritage Breed by the Livestock Conservancy and is part of the rare breeds program at Colonial Williamsburg. The exact origin of the breed is unknown, although their initial creation may have involved European chicken breeds and later in its refinement, some Asian varieties. The name of “Dominique” may have come from birds that were imported from the French colony of Saint-Domingue (today known as Haiti) and which are thought to have been used as part of the development of the Dominique breed.</p>

    <p>Barred chickens with both rose combs and single combs were somewhat common in the eastern United States as early as 1750. As interest in poultry breeding increased, attention was given to develop uniformity in chicken breeds. Early names of these fowl include Blue Spotted Hen, Old Grey Hen, Dominico, Dominic, and Dominicker. The breed was widely known on the eastern coast of the U.S. as the Dominique.</p>

    <p>The Dominique was plentifully bred on American farms as early as the 1820’s, where these birds were a popular dual-purpose fowl. In 1871 the New York Poultry Society decided that only the rose combed Dominique would become the standard for the breed and the single combed Dominiques were relegated to and folded into the Plymouth Rock breed – popular in New England, created by crossing large, single comb Dominiques with Java chickens. Dominiques were never used commercially, and the breed was eventually eclipsed on the farm by the gradual shift to the larger “Plymouth Rocks.” In 1874 the Dominique breed was officially admitted to the American Poultry Association’s Standard of Perfection.</p>

    <p>The Dominique enjoyed popularity until the 1920’s at which time interest in the breed waned due to the passing of aged, long-time Dominique enthusiasts and breeders. The breed managed to survive during the Great Depression of the 1930’s due to its hardiness and ease of up-keep. By the end of World War II as industrial poultry operations began to take a foothold in the U.S., the Dominique once again experienced decline. By 1970 only 4 known flocks remained, held by: Henry Miller, Edward Uber, Robert Henderson, and Carl Gallaher. Through the effort of dedicated individuals the remaining owners were contacted and convinced to participate in a breed rescue. From 1983, following published reports on the breed by ALBC, until 2006, Dominiques steadily rose in numbers. As of 2007, it has been observed by the breed’s enthusiasts that numbers are once again beginning to decline, as old time breeders of Dominique age and are no longer involved with keeping and promoting the breed.</p>

    <p>The Dominique is a medium-sized black and white barred (otherwise known as “cuckoo” patterned) bird. The barred plumage coloration is also referred to as hawk-colored and serves the Dominique in making the bird less conspicuous to predators. The Dominique sports a rose comb with a short upward curving spike that is characteristic to this breed. The males average seven pounds and the females five pounds. The Dominique’s tightly arranged plumage, combined with the low profile of the rose comb, make this breed more resistant to frostbite than many other breeds of fowl. Dominiques are also known to adapt well to hot and humid climates. Historically the close feathering of this breed not only protected the birds in cold weather, but provided ample material for the pillows and featherbeds of their owners.</p>

    <p>Dominiques carry their heads high up on well-arched necks. The males of the breed have an almost “u” shaped back outline. Their body is broad and full with long and full tail feathers that are held the highest of the American breeds. Females have back outlines that slope from head to tail. Although categorized as a dual-purpose breed, these birds are first and foremost egg producers with hens historically averaging 230-275 small- to medium-sized brown eggs.</p>

    <h5>English Shepherds</h5>
      <figure><img src="images/shepherd_lg.jpg" alt="side view of English Shepherd sheepdog"><figcaption>The Old Fashioned Farm Shepherd</figcaption></figure> 
      
      <p>The English Shepherd is an extremely versatile breed of working farm dog of the collie lineage, developed in the United States from farm dogs brought by English and Scottish settlers in the 17th through 19th centuries before pedigrees became fashionable around the end of the 19th century. Subsistence farmers appreciated the breed for their versatility and not for their flash or strict conformation to a standard of appearance.</p>

    <p>Originating in northern England and Scotland, these dogs came with the first settlers to reach the American colonies. American farmers appreciated this versatile breed and used dogs to protect their farms and livestock.  English Shepherd is known variously as the farm shepherd, the barnyard collie, the old fashioned shepherd, the cow dog or the English Shepherd. There is not a more alert, trustworthy, or ordinary American shepherd dog that one sees on farm after farm throughout the country.</p>

    <p>The English Shepherd is a highly intelligent, all-around farm dog, being used as a herding dog, livestock guardian, farm watch dog, hunting dog, vermin eradicator and a child's companion. English Shepherds were not bred to be specialized to work one type of livestock as some recent herding dogs have been. English Shepherds were bred to do many tasks on the small diversified farms of the 17th through early 20th centuries that had various types of livestock including cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, and fowl. It may have been the most common breed in America during the 19th and early 20th century.</p>

    <p>However, as the small diversified farms in the mid-western and eastern United States dwindled in numbers, many of them replaced by larger and less diversified operations, the English Shepherd became a rare breed.</p>

    <p>The English Shepherd temperament is the defining characteristic of the breed, with high intelligence and often a unique type of kindness for those in his home, both animals and people. The English Shepherd is often an independent worker, are adaptable and learn routines quickly. Once the English Shepherd accepts the people, children or stock as his own, there are few better caretakers.</p>

        <h5 class="notfirstsec">Why Heritage Breeds?</h5>
        <p>Traditionally, farmers throughout the world have raised thousands of different animal breeds. However, since today’s industrial farms rely upon only a few specialized types of livestock, thousands of non-commercial animal breeds have disappeared, along with the valuable genetic diversity they possessed. Fortunately, a growing number of sustainable farmers are preserving agricultural variety and protecting biodiversity by raising “heritage” or “heirloom” animal breeds.</p>
        <p>Heritage Livestock breeds are traditional livestock breeds that were raised by farmers in the past, before the drastic reduction of breed variety caused by the rise of industrial agriculture. Within the past 15-20 years, approximately 190 breeds of farm animals have gone extinct worldwide, and there are currently approximately 1,500 others at risk of becoming extinct. In the past 5-10 years alone, approximately 60 breeds of cattle, goats, pigs, horses and poultry have become extinct.  Furthermore, in the US, a few main breeds dominate the livestock industry including:</p>
        <ul>
           <li> approximately 83% of dairy cows are Holsteins and that five main breeds comprise almost all of the dairy herds in the US.</li>
            <li>approximately 60% of beef cattle are of the Angus, Hereford or Simmental breeds.</li>
            <li>approximately 75% of pigs in the US come from only 3 main breeds.</li>
            <li>approximately 60% of sheep come from only four breeds, and 40 percent are Suffolk-breed sheep.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Heritage animals were bred over time to develop traits that made them particularly well-adapted to local environmental conditions. Breeds used in industrial agriculture are bred to produce lots of milk or eggs, gain weight quickly, or yield particular types of meat within confined facilities. Heritage breeds are generally better adapted to withstand disease and survive in harsh environmental conditions, and their bodies can be better suited to living on pasture.</p>

        <p>These livestock breeds also serve as an important genetic resource, and when heritage breeds become extinct, their unique genes are lost forever and can’t be used to breed new traits into existing livestock breeds. Therefore, by raising heritage livestock breeds, sustainable farmers not only maintain variety within our livestock populations, they also help to preserve valuable traits within the species so that future breeds can endure harsh conditions.</p>

        <p>There is no official definition or certification for “heritage” animals, but for a livestock breed to be truly heritage, it must have unique genetic traits and also be raised on a sustainable farm. Heritage animals are well-suited to sustainable farms since they are able to survive without the temperature-controlled buildings and constant doses of antibiotics administered to the commercial breeds raised on factory farms.</p>

        <p>Remnant groups of many historic livestock breeds face new obstacles as modern agriculture favors “improved” breeds. Even worse, many foundational breeds of American agriculture are on the verge of going extinct. Today, let’s celebrate some of the four-legged settlers that became the foundation stock of modern American agriculture. They are a living testament to our past, and a genetic resource for our future.</p> -->
