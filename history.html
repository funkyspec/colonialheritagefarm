                        <p>Colonial Farms has a rich history dating back to the early American colonial period. The property, for much of its early history, consisted of a large stone dwelling house, a mill race, a grist mill, a saw mill, a stone wash house, smoke house, spring house, log house and log barn. Please scroll down for a summary of our history, from 1744 to the present.</p>


                        <h5>1744 &ndash; 1761</h5>
                        <p>Early colonial American settlers typically located near a stream or a creek for access to valuable water resources, of which there was an abundant supply throughout Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia.</p>

                        <p> Michael McQuire, a farmer, and his wife, Patience chose the Great Pipe Creek (now Big Pipe Creek) in Frederick County (now Carroll County).</p>

                        <p>Michael McGuire was born around 1694 and died in 1789 in Fredrick Co. Maryland.  He was a Catholic. He married Patience Wells, daughter of James Wells and Ann Thornborough. The Wells were a Protestant family from Baltimore County.</p>

                        <p>The earliest available reference to Michael McGuire dates from 1735 and locates him among the first Catholic settlers on the Maryland/Pennsylvania frontier.  McGuire apparently worked on the John Lemon farm from 1735 to 1737. This farm was located in near Conewago in Adams Co., PA about midway between McSherrystown and Littlestown, just west of the Hanover Reservoir.</p>

                        <p>At Conewago, McGuire evaded religious persecution but was unable to avoid serious boundary confrontations between Maryland and Pennsylvania.  Since both the Calverts and the Penns claimed the Conewago Valley, laws were difficult to enforce and border skirmishes became a frequent occurrence.  These circumstances probably influenced McGuire's decision to move southward to the vicinity of Taneytown, a village founded by the Catholic Taneys in 1740.</p>

                        <p>McGuire had a survey done and obtained a Maryland patent in 1744 for 100 acres of land near Taneytown. The tract was named &ldquo;Patience (and) Care&rdquo;, after his wife.</p>

                        <p>McGuire was apparently not able to completely evade religious persecution in Maryland since McGuire was actually labeled a &ldquo;Papist&rdquo; in the official tax records and the official Debt Book of Frederick Co., MD.</p>

                        <p>In 1752, McGuire was once again drawn into the Maryland / Pennsylvania border disputes when apparently Dudley Digges, son of John Digges, was killed on the Kitzmiller farm at Conewago.  The records show that Michael McGuire had to testify at this long trial.</p>

                        <p>In 1754, Michael McGuire purchased 785 additional acres along Pipe Creek from Henrietta Marie Dulany, widow of the prominent landowner, Daniel Dulany, Sr.</p>

                        <p>On 7 September 1754, another survey was made. The patent, RESURVEY ON PATIENCE CARE, was granted on 27 November 1754. This tract now consisted of 885 acres of land.</p>

                        <p>The new McGuire lands were evidently of considerable value since later legal records of the property mention a mill race and several tracts of timber. McGuire's prospects and those of his sons now depended upon their ability to profit from this investment.</p>

                        <p>However, the outbreak of war also resulted in tax increases, a circumstance which led Michael McGuire to present the following petition to the Frederick County Court in 1758: &ldquo;To the worshipfull Bench of Justice of Frederick County the petition of Michael McGuire humbly therewith that your petitioner has so many years in this County and has Constantly and Cheerfully paid his public dues and would gladly continue to do so but am now being arrived at the age of sixty odd...and am likewise now very infirm and not able to labor and my family large (10 children) and has lately afflicted with the small pox which together with several other misfortunes now happening has greatly reduced me and worships according to your usual goodness release him in his great necessity from paying taxes.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>When this appeal was denied by the court, McGuire was forced to borrow large sums of money from gentlemen such as Charles Carroll, Barrister. Not until 1761 when Basil Dorsey released his mortgage on "Patience Care" did the McGuire's financial affairs begin to improve.</p>

                        <p>With his property free of encumbrances, McGuire was now legally able to transfer portions of his land to two of his sons, John and Captain Michael Junior.</p>
                        
                        <p>Captain Michael McGuire (son of Michael McGuire, Sr. and Patience Wells) was born in 1717 in Fredrick County Maryland, and died November 17, 1793 in Allegheny Township, Pennsylvania. He married Rachel Brown on October 03, 1766 in Taneytown, Maryland.  Captain Michael McGuire served in the Maryland Militia during the Revolutionary War and was a Revolutionary War hero who fought in Boston at the Battle of Breeds Hill in June 1775 and also fought at Yorktown which led to the capture of a British sword that remained in the McGuire family’s possession for generations. In 1788, Captain Michael McGuire lead a group of Catholics from Maryland to the area of his hunting lodge in Pennsylvania and formed a new Catholic community known as the McGuire settlement that later became known as Loretto, PA. Captain Michael McGuire donated over 400 acres of his tract to Bishop John Carroll, the first Catholic Bishop in America, for the purpose of establishing a Catholic Church and community at the settlement.</p>
                        
                        <p>On 20 March 1761, Michael McGuire, Sr. and Patience sold to Joseph Dyer 331 acres from their RESURVEY ON PATIENCE CARE tract for 50 pounds sterling money of Great Britain.</p>

                        <h5>1761 &ndash; 1778</h5>

                        <p>Joseph Dyer was from Sussex County, West Jersey and was a saddler and farmer.</p>

                        <p>As new areas were being settled in early Colonial America, one of the first industries that was established were the mills, particularly the grist mills and saw mills.</p>

                        <p>The 1761 deed between McQuire and Dyer included a mill race and further granted the "free privilege of all the water in Great Pipe Creek to turn the said waters in the above said mill race for the use of a mill or mills or for any other use or purpose."</p>

                        <p>On 26 April 1763, Dyer had a survey made.  The patent, DYER'S MILL FOREST, was granted on 30 May 1763 and encompassed 1,168 acres with the metes and bounds description also including the mill race.</p>

                        <p>On 26 February 1778, Joseph Dyer and his wife, Joannah, sold to John Groff 500 acres of DYER'S MILL FORREST on Big Pipe Creek, including the same mill race, for the sum of 2000 pounds current common money.</p>

                        <h5>1778 &ndash; 1801</h5>

                        <p>John Groff was a farmer from Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania. During the American Revolution, there were many loyalists, or “Tories” as the Patriots called them, who remained loyal to Great Britain.  Many from the German communities of Pennsylvania, including John Groff, did not support the Patriot cause in the Revolutionary War.  This may have influenced John Groff’s decision to leave Philadelphia and come to Maryland in 1778.</p>

                        <p>In fact, in the <em>History of Western Maryland</em> by Thomas Scharf (p. 814), Scharf states that the grist mill was built in 1776 by two Tories named Groff who had been driven out of Philadelphia. They ultimately suppressed their opinions and eventually prospered in what was then Frederick County, Maryland.</p>

                        <p>The 1778 deed between Dyer and John Groff contained no metes and bounds description, but did state that it included all houses, buildings, orchards, gardens, meadows, water ways, water courses, etc. This was probably the part of DYER'S MILL FOREST on which the “stone dwelling house” and mill and/or mill race was located.</p>

                        <p>The Griffith's 1794 map of Maryland shows thirty-one mills in the area of present-day Carroll County. One of them is Groff's Mill and it is shown to be located on the south side of Big Pipe Creek. This is the first indication of the mill being of a commercial nature.</p>

                        <p>Tobacco was the major crop throughout Carroll County until Dr. John Stevenson, the "Father of Baltimore", influenced the wealthy Charles Carroll of Carrollton and others to switch to wheat and other grains. The cultivation of grains was less intensive than that of tobacco and more suited to the physical aspects of the soil, especially in the northern part of the county. Furthermore, the growth of the port of Baltimore provided an outlet to ready markets for grain or for milled flour. Before long, many more mills were built to accommodate the county’s increased grain production.  Roads leading to these mills were built and most of these roads are in use today and still bear the name of the mill.</p>

                        <p>In Scharf's <em>History of Western Maryland</em>, it states that (in 1882) "west of Union Mills, on Big Pipe Creek, James E. Dodrer has a flouring mill, once called 'Old Groves Mills' but put down on the old map made a century ago as 'Groff's Mills'"</p>

                        <p>In 1787, John Groff, evidently sick and fearing that he would soon die, made a will in which his wife and ten surviving children were well provided for. He directed that his wife, Elizabeth, was to have sole use of two upstairs rooms and the privilege of using the kitchen in the home that his son, Francis, shared with her. If this arrangement did not suit them, he was to build Elizabeth a home that did. </p>

                        <p>Because this arrangement was requested by John Groff in his will written in 1787, the “stone dwelling house” would have been constructed prior to 1787, possibly in about 1781, if not earlier.</p>

                        <p>It was not until ten years later on 7 June 1797 that John Groff did die and soon after the tax assessments show that his heirs built a small stone kitchen and made improvements to the mill by 1798. Also, John’s widow, Elizabeth, quit her claim to her husband's bequests and elected to take instead her dower, or 1/3 of the deceased's real and personal estate.</p>

                        <p>In 1801, she deeded her widow's dower to her son, Francis, with a life estate provision which included the sharing of the “stone dwelling house”. At the same time, Francis recorded in the land records that certain provisions would be provided Elizabeth during her lifetime, which included, among other things, use of the northernmost half of the "stone dwelling house."</p>

                        <p><strong>Slavery</strong> &ndash; Slavery was a controversial issue in the county. Most of the slaves lived in the southern part of the county to provide labor for the tobacco industry. Only a few families in the Myers district owned slaves. Elizabeth's advancing age and Francis' and Catherine's lack of children may have prompted them to keep slaves to help as domestics, farm hands and in the mills. In fact, Francis and his mother became slave owners in about 1800. The 1800 U. S. Census lists Elizabeth Groff as head of a household which included 1 free white female (over 45 years) and 1 slave. The 1800 U. S. Census  also lists Francis Groff's household which included 3 free white males (26 to 45 years), 1 free white female (26 to 45 years) and 3 slaves. The 1830 Census shows Francis Groff owning 4 slaves, but by 1837 he was only assessed for one slave which may indicate he was leasing his mills and farm as he did at the time of his death in 1847.</p>

                        <p>John Groff (born c. 1724 and died 1797) and Elizabeth Groff (born c. 1743 and died 1809) are both buried in the town of Silver Run at St Mary’s Church and cemetery, which was also part of the original 1,168 acre DYER’S MILL FOREST tract.</p>

                        <h5>1801 &ndash; 1865</h5>

                        <p>In 1801, Francis Groff, son of John and Elizabeth Groff, inherited the stone home and mills through his father's will and through his mother’s life estate agreement. Until her death on 9 June 1809, they shared the “stone dwelling house”.</p>

                        <p>By the end of the 18th century, the area which would become Carroll County had advanced well beyond the primitive frontier conditions of fifty years before. The conditions of daily life in 1800 were still harsh by twentieth century standards, but the population was small, good farming land was readily available and there was abundant opportunity for improvement.</p>

                        <p>Barns and farmhouses dotted the county landscape, but perhaps the most significant buildings were the grist mills which ground grain for consumption and for sale and export via the port of Baltimore.  Because milling was such an important industry, many millers became quite prosperous.</p>

                        <p>The high prices for farm goods during the War of 1812, when a barrel of flour brought $14.00 (compared to the 1837 price of $7.62 per barrel), would have boosted farm production and mill income. Whether it was farm commodity inflation, war or just good business, Francis Groff became a prosperous man. He ran the farm and the mills until advancing age caused him to rent them; the mills to Jacob Bankert and the farm to George King in the years prior to his death.</p>

                        <p>Francis died on 28 August 1847 at the age of 85.  He is also buried in the town of Silver Run at St Mary’s Church and cemetery. His wife Catherine Groff continued to live on the property until about 1865.</p>

                        <p>In 1865, Catherine Groff relinquished her right in the property and requested that it be sold and that the proceeds be divided as by will. The improvements on the property at the time of the sale consisted of a stone mill, a saw mill, three log houses, a two story stone house with back building, stone wash and smoke house, two spring houses (one of them stone), and two log barns. The property was sold in 4 tracts.  It was at this time in 1865 that the “stone dwelling house” with 195 acres was separated from the mill property.</p>

                        <p>Catherine died in 1868, age 93, and was probably buried in Berk's County, Pennsylvania near her childhood home.</p>

                        <p><strong>Slavery</strong> &ndash; In his will, Francis Groff bequeathed to his wife, Catherine, a female slave named Elizabeth Horn who was to go free after the death of his wife. There are no manumission records in Carroll County to show the freeing of Elizabeth Horn and she is not listed in the 1850 Census or the 1850 Slave Schedule for the Myer's District. In Catherine Groff's will (1867), however, she does mention Elizabeth Horn in her bequests and in the second administrative account (1866) of Francis Groff's estate, $200 was retained to be paid to Elizabeth Horn. Why she did not live with Catherine in Carroll County during the 1850's is not known.</p>

                        <p>Abraham Nusbaum bought 195 acres of GROFF’S FORREST from the executor of Francis and Catherine’s estate.  Abraham Nusbaum lived in a different district of the county. He let his daughter and son-in-law occupy the farm. He died in 1884 and left the "Grove Farm" to his wife. In 1888 it was advertised as having “a good quarry of excellent blue limestone”. It was sold privately to Absalom Leppo in 1888 at a lesser sum than originally paid for, after several unsuccessful attempts at public sales.</p>

                        <p>Absalom Leppo, who purchased the farm from Abraham and Ellen Nusbaum’s estate administrator, increased the acreage (212 acres) and possibly "spruced up and modernized" the house with the Victorian influence (i.e. front porch) since the price nearly doubled when it passed to John Humbert in 1912.</p>

                        <p>The property contained three dwellings, three barns, and other buildings plus four additional acres.  The property remained with the Humberts for twenty five years when they ran into some bad times.  The property was sold at a foreclosure sale in 1937 to David J. Wantz and his wife at less than one-half of the purchase price.</p>

                        <p>David Wantz, after his wife's death, sold the property to Truman R. AhaIt in 1974 with a life-estate provision for the stone dwelling house, two fields, shop and saw mill. The life-estate was surrendered in 1977, shortly before Truman AhaIt sold the house and property to Eric August Ganjon, Sr., except for two off-conveyances of about 16 acres.</p>

                        <p>In February 1980, Eric August Ganjon sold this historic property to the Edward M. Kelly and Sons Partnership. The present owner, Stephen Kelly, who is the son of Edward M. Kelly Sr., purchased 170.302 acres from the Partnership in 1999.</p>

                        <p>The present owner has worked toward preserving the historic stone house, a smoke house and a lime kiln that date back to the 1770s or 1780s. To this day, this historic stone house continues to exemplify the home of a prosperous family of the mid to late 1700's. The house is also an excellent example of a mid to late 1700’s stone, two-story, five bay house with an early stone wing to the rear. The house still retains a good number of its original features (i.e., detailing, windows, doors, hardware, fireplaces, etc.) and feeling.</p>

                        <p>A large, four bay bank barn that was constructed in 1888, has also been preserved, along with other barns and outbuildings. Additionally, a mid to late 1800's summer house has been preserved as a tenant house. The nearby grist mill still stands today, although not currently connected to the farm.</p>

                        <p>Even today, one can easily visualize how the house and adjoining property must have been as it was during the American Revolution and the early colonial American period.</p>

                        <p>The farm has been dedicated to Caroline, Brendan, Kathleen and Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam.</p>
