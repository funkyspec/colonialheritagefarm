    <h4>About Our Farm</h4>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="eight columns">
        
        <p>The Colonial Heritage Farm is a historic farm located in Westminster, Maryland that endeavors to preserve our agricultural heritage.</p><p>The Farm raises and markets heritage livestock breeds. Heritage livestock breeds are typically historic and/or rare breeds that may have fallen out of favor with today's modern industrial farming practices. Promoting historic livestock breeds and safeguarding their genetic diversity is an important Farm objective.</p><p>Marketing heritage farm products helps to reestablish the demand for these historic livestock breeds.  Furthermore, the Farm's heritage beef, heritage lamb and heritage eggs are not only produced locally, but they are grown more naturally and more nutritionally since they are raised utilizing sustainable pasture based farming practices.</p><p>The Colonial Heritage Farm also focuses on historic preservation. The Farm has deep historical roots dating back to the American colonial period and the American Revolution in the 1700s. Significant effort continues to this day to maintain and preserve this historic colonial farm as well as to safeguard its agricultural heritage.</p>

        <h5>Why support our farm?</h5>
        <p>When you support our farm, you are supporting our farming practices, namely <strong>sustainable farming through pasture-based livestock systems.</strong></p>
        <p>These systems provide substantial health benefits to humans and animals, as well as environmental benefits.</p>
        <p>Truly sustainable livestock farming requires the use of a pasture-based system. Pasture-raised animals graze freely in their natural environment where they're able to eat nutritious grasses and other plants that their bodies are adapted to digest. In addition to dramatically improving the welfare of farm animals, pasturing also helps reduce environmental damage, and yields meat, eggs, and dairy products that are tastier and more nutritious than foods produced on industrialized farms.</p>
        <p><strong>Animal Health Benefits</strong> - Animals raised on pasture enjoy a much higher quality of life than those confined within industrialized farms. When raised on open pasture, animals are able to move around freely and carry out their natural behaviors. This lifestyle is impossible to achieve on industrial farms, where thousands of animals are crowded into confined facilities, often without access to fresh air or sunlight. These stressful conditions are a breeding ground for bacteria and the animals frequently become ill, so industrialized farms must routinely treat them with antibiotics to prevent outbreaks of disease.</p><p>Grazing on pasture is especially beneficial for cattle and other ruminants, whose bodies are developed to eat grass. The roughage provided by grasses and other plants allows ruminants to produce saliva, which helps neutralize acids that exist naturally in their digestive systems. When taken off pasture and put on a diet of grain, a ruminant will produce less saliva, causing an increase in acidity within its digestive tract. As a result, grain-fed cattle often suffer from a number of health problems including intestinal damage, dehydration, liver abscesses and even death.</p><p>Despite the fact that grain diets can sicken cattle and other ruminants, industrialized farms feed these animals grain (usually corn or soybeans) because it’s a cheap way to fatten animals and force them to grow to market weight as quickly as possible.</p><p>Pasture-raised animals also enjoy a diet free of the unnatural feed additives routinely administered on industrialized farms. These farms frequently supplement animal feed with a range of byproducts including chicken manure, plate waste from restaurants, and animal blood in order to bolster the quantity and protein content of the feed. Antibiotics and artificial hormones are also added to promote rapid growth. On pasture, animals get all the nutrients they need from grass and forage (other plants), and some animals, like chickens, get additional vitamins and protein from eating insects.</p><p><strong>Human Health Benefits</strong> - A growing body of research indicates that pasture-raised meat, eggs, and dairy products are better for consumers' health than conventionally-raised, grain-fed foods. In addition to being lower in calories and total fat, pasture-raised foods have higher levels of vitamins, and a healthier balance of omega-3 and omega-6 fats than conventional meat and dairy products.</p><p>Studies have shown that milk from pasture-fed cows has as much as five times the CLA (a type of fatty acid) as milk from grain-fed cows. And meat from pasture-fed cows has from 200 to 500 % more CLA as a proportion of total fatty acids than meat from cows that eat a primarily grain-based diet.</p><p>Cage free and free-range and chickens typically have 21% less total fat, 30% less saturated fat and 28% fewer calories than their factory-farmed counterparts. Eggs from poultry raised on pasture have 10% less fat, 40% more vitamin A and 400% more omega-3’s.</p><p><strong>Environmental Benefits</strong> - Pasture-based systems can help the environment, especially through fertilizing the soil and by reducing the amount of grain produced as feed. And unlike industrial farms, which rely on large amounts of fossil fuels to truck feed and animal waste, pasture-based systems take advantage of the animal’s ability to feed itself and spread its own manure.</p>

         <h5>Our Mission</h5>
        <p>The Colonial Heritage Farm’s overall mission is to help preserve our agricultural heritage.  To that end, the Farm has four main objectives:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Preservation of Heritage Livestock Breeds - the Farm works to safeguard and maintain historic and heirloom livestock breeds and their genetic diversity</li>
          <li>Sale of Healthy and Locally Grown Heritage Farm Products - the Farm markets natural, nutritional and pasture raised heritage meats and eggs</li>
          <li>Utilization of Sustainable Agricultural Practices - the Farm utilizes pasture based livestock systems that protect our environment and also provide health benefits to both humans and animals</li>
          <li>Preservation of a Historical Farm - the Farm continues its efforts to maintain and preserve the farm's agricultural heritage including a historic stone house and smoke house built c.1781, a historic bank barn built in 1888 and various other barns and outbuildings</li>
