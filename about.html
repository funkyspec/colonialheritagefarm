        <h4>About Our Farm</h4>
        <p>The Colonial Heritage Farm is a historic farm located in Westminster, Maryland that endeavors to preserve our agricultural heritage.</p><p>The Farm raises and markets heritage livestock breeds. Heritage livestock breeds are typically historic and/or rare breeds that may have fallen out of favor with today's modern industrial farming practices. Promoting historic livestock breeds and safeguarding their genetic diversity is an important Farm objective.</p><p>Marketing heritage farm products helps to reestablish the demand for these historic livestock breeds.  Furthermore, the Farm's heritage beef, heritage lamb and heritage eggs are not only produced locally, but they are grown more naturally and more nutritionally since they are raised utilizing sustainable pasture based farming practices.</p><p>The Colonial Heritage Farm also focuses on historic preservation. The Farm has deep historical roots dating back to the American colonial period and the American Revolution in the 1700s. Significant effort continues to this day to maintain and preserve this historic colonial farm as well as to safeguard its agricultural heritage.</p>

        <h4 class="notfirstsec">About the Colonial Revival Movement</h4>

         <p>The Colonial Heritage Farm has been particularly inspired by the historic preservation efforts at the National Colonial Farm in Accokeek, MD, the Claude Moore Colonial Farm in McLean, VA and the Great Hopes Plantation at Colonial Williamsburg.  Additionally, the Farm’s ongoing preservation efforts are a product of the “Colonial Revival movement”.</p>
        
        <p>The Colonial Revival movement emerged in 1876 with America's Centennial celebration.  Historic preservation formed the core of the Colonial Revival movement.  As a result, there was a growing interest in preservation of historic buildings.  Private individuals and preservation societies purchased historic plantation homes and restored and furnished them for personal and public use.  Colonial Williamsburg is one such example, among many, of this interest in historical preservation inspired by the Colonial Revival movement.</p>
        
        <p>With the Colonial Revival movement, interest in American colonial history flourished. Artists, writers, architects and antique collectors helped to bring such idealized images of early American colonial life to the wider public.</p>
        
        <p>At its heart, the Colonial Revival movement romanticized and tried to re-capture the patriotic spirit of America's colonial past and inspired a nostalgic return to early American colonial traditions. The early American colonial era was looked upon as a golden age of American values, when hard working pioneers sustained their families through farming and when American patriots heroically fought for our independence in conjunction with America's Founding Fathers.</p>
        
        <p>Indeed, the Colonial Heritage Farm endeavors to preserve some of the history and keep alive some of the patriotic spirit from America’s colonial past.</p>
