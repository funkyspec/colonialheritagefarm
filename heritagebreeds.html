                        <p>Traditionally, farmers throughout the world have raised thousands of different animal breeds. However, since today’s industrial farms rely upon only a few specialized types of livestock, thousands of non-commercial animal breeds have disappeared, along with the valuable genetic diversity they possessed. Fortunately, a growing number of sustainable farmers are preserving agricultural variety and protecting biodiversity by raising “heritage” or “heirloom” animal breeds.</p>
                        <p>Heritage Livestock breeds are traditional livestock breeds that were raised by farmers in the past, before the drastic reduction of breed variety caused by the rise of industrial agriculture. Within the past 15-20 years, approximately 190 breeds of farm animals have gone extinct worldwide, and there are currently approximately 1,500 others at risk of becoming extinct. In the past 5-10 years alone, approximately 60 breeds of cattle, goats, pigs, horses and poultry have become extinct.  Furthermore, in the US, a few main breeds dominate the livestock industry including:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li> approximately 83% of dairy cows are Holsteins and that five main breeds comprise almost all of the dairy herds in the US.</li>
                            <li>approximately 60% of beef cattle are of the Angus, Hereford or Simmental breeds.</li>
                            <li>approximately 75% of pigs in the US come from only 3 main breeds.</li>
                            <li>approximately 60% of sheep come from only four breeds, and 40 percent are Suffolk-breed sheep.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Heritage animals were bred over time to develop traits that made them particularly well-adapted to local environmental conditions. Breeds used in industrial agriculture are bred to produce lots of milk or eggs, gain weight quickly, or yield particular types of meat within confined facilities. Heritage breeds are generally better adapted to withstand disease and survive in harsh environmental conditions, and their bodies can be better suited to living on pasture.</p>

                        <p>These livestock breeds also serve as an important genetic resource, and when heritage breeds become extinct, their unique genes are lost forever and can’t be used to breed new traits into existing livestock breeds. Therefore, by raising heritage livestock breeds, sustainable farmers not only maintain variety within our livestock populations, they also help to preserve valuable traits within the species so that future breeds can endure harsh conditions.</p>

                        <p>There is no official definition or certification for “heritage” animals, but for a livestock breed to be truly heritage, it must have unique genetic traits and also be raised on a sustainable farm. Heritage animals are well-suited to sustainable farms since they are able to survive without the temperature-controlled buildings and constant doses of antibiotics administered to the commercial breeds raised on factory farms.</p>

                        <p>Remnant groups of many historic livestock breeds face new obstacles as modern agriculture favors “improved” breeds. Even worse, many foundational breeds of American agriculture are on the verge of going extinct. Today, let’s celebrate some of the four-legged settlers that became the foundation stock of modern American agriculture. They are a living testament to our past, and a genetic resource for our future.</p>
