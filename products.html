        <h5>Why buy our products?</h5>
       <p><strong>Keeping Small and Local Farmers in Business</strong> - When you buy pastured heritage meat and heritage cage free eggs, you're not only taking a step to safeguard your health, protect the environment, and improve animal wellbeing, you're also supporting sustainable farming and the local farmers who choose to practice it. Small, local family farmers are invaluable members of the nation’s rural communities and play a key role as stewards of the land.</p>
      <p><strong>Preserving Heritage Livestock and their Genetic Diversity</strong> - When you buy heritage meat and heritage cage free eggs you are preserving heritage livestock genetic diversity. As part of our historical activities, we preserve heritage breeds of farm animals. Since today’s industrial farms rely upon only a few specialized types of livestock, thousands of non-commercial animal breeds have disappeared, along with the valuable genetic diversity they possessed.  Heritage breeds of animals carry valuable genetic diversity that would be lost without preservation efforts. The unique gene pools of these animals have global significance.</p>
      <p><strong>Supporting Sustainable Farming is both Healthy and Environmentally Beneficial</strong> - When you buy heritage meat and cage free eggs you are promoting substantial health benefits to both humans and animals as well as environmental benefits.  Sustainable Farming through pasture raised livestock provides significant health benefits to humans and animals since the meat products are substantially more natural and nutritional.  Furthermore, pasture-based systems can help the environment, especially through self-fertilization of the soil and by reducing the amount of energy intensive grain utilized by industrial farms.</p>
